      <p>
          Welcome to "How to make a README and use 
          a README Generator"! We will cover a two-part 
          tutorial on making a README and utilizing the 
          README Generator that we created. You will need 
          experience with Github and an Integrated 
          Development Environment (IDE) for this tutorial.

      <h1>How to make a README steps:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open your repository in your choice of IDE, 
          whether it be Visual Studios, Atom, or others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Navigate to the root directory of your current 
          repository. In Visual Studios, this can be done 
          through navigating through folders in the left hand 
          side display; in Atom, this can be done through your 
          file browser window.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a new file. When prompted for a name 
            for the file, enter "README.md"
        </li>
        <li>
            Now that we have the file created, it is time to begin 
            the README. FIrst line should be of a format similar to:
            <ul>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <li>
                    That is, including a single hash (#) followed 
                    by the project name.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, create a heading for Description, again starting 
            with a single hash. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Type  ‘##’ to create a Table of Contents</br>
            To link sections to the table of contents, follow the 
            image below.
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <img
              class="img"
              src=code.png>
        </li>
        <li>
            Type ‘##’ prior to each section name. </br> 
            Ex:  ## Installation 
            <ul>
              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <li>
                  Installation: </br>
                  To install the necessary dependencies, 
                  type the commands in this section. 
              </li>
              <li>
                  License: </br>
                  Refer to the License section. 
              </li>
              <li>
                  Contributing: </br>
                  Notify the reader to contact you if 
                  they intend to contribute to the  repository. 
              </li>
              <li>
                  Tests: </br>
                  The test section provides commands to run different 
                  tests that can be executed. The user’s program may
                  have coding examples that run with the main program. 
                  Provides instructions for grader/user pulling from repo.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Questions: </br>
                  Inform the reader that you are open to questions and 
                  discussion about your program. 
              </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Licensing. Many options exist for choosing a license for 
            your project, depending on how you want others to use 
            your project. In order to insert a license into a project,
            simply create a new file containing one of the following 
            license formats. When choosing a license, it is important 
            to consider freedoms of distribution, sourcing & citations,
            and warranties and liabilities. These topics will be 
            covered below.

        entitled Description, table of contents, installation, usage, license,
        contributing, tests, and questions

                          AGPL is very similar to GPL, but contains additional
                           clauses allowing works transferred over a network 
                           to be protected, such as a server. With GPL, an end 
                           user could legally copy and host an exact copy of 
                           the author's server and act as a competitor; this 
                           is not the case with AGPL.

                          Although similar to GPL v3, this license does not
                           allow as many adjustments as GPL v3, including 
                           lacking the ability to close-source. It has less 
                           flexibility with other licenses, there are some 
                           gray areas regarding patents and DRM, and lack of 
                           discussion of violations. For some licensing purists,
                            v2 is preferred; maybe you may be inspired to make 
                            similar licensing choices as them.

                          Similar to the GNU GPL, LGPL allows proprietary 
                          software developers to use LGPL code in their products.
                           However, they are not required to abide by nearly as
                            many terms in order to do so. The only requirements 
                            for using code licensed under LGPL in proprietary 
                            software is in regards to using modified versions 
                            of LGPL code: modified LGPL code must be published 
                            separately under the same license.

                        Without choosing a license, rights will be determined 
                        based on where repositories are hosted. For example, 
                        on github, default copyright restrictions will be applied,
                         as according to Brian Doll, GitHub's VP of Marketing: 
                         "Code without an explicit license is protected by 
                         copyright and is by default All Rights Reserved. The 
                         person or people who wrote the code are protected as 
                         such. Any time you're using software you didn't write, 
                         licensing should be considered and abided." This practice 
                         of protecting code with All Rights Reserved is common across
                          code repository hosts and should be considered the default 
                          when publishing code without a license to a 3rd party host.
